# Markov Chain

In this project our aim was to use Markov Chain model to classify varius sequences. This project was assigned to us in the course of BIO 331 - Computational and Systems Biology.

_Subject 1:_ Identification of generalized classes of protein molecules.

_Subject 2:_ Identification of proteins with local "abnormal" amino acid composition

_Subject 3:_ Classification of proteins in families

This project was created to check the results of the Markov chain project and compare them with other existing program results.

## Getting Started

You can download this project from the link below:

https://github.com/snikol03/Markov-Chain-Project.git

## Prerequisites

To run this project you need to install perl. You can download and install perl from the following link.

https://www.perl.org/get.html

After the download and installation you can run the program with the terminal or the command line.

## Running the tests

To execute this project run the following command in the terminal depending on the perpose you want.

_Subject 1:_ Identification of generalized classes of protein molecules run

`perl thema1.pl`

When this command is executed you will be asked to insert the path of the positive and negative file. Then a menu will appear asking you to select directory. At this point there are three options: 1.DNA, 2.RNA and 3.Proteins. The input must be the number of the choice. After that the user have to insert the Markov chain window size. This are the general

_Subject 2:_ Identification of proteins with local "abnormal" amino acid
composition run

`perl thema2.pl`

_Subject 3:_ Classification of proteins in families run

`perl thema3.pl`


For each Thema you can select a combination of the following three modes: 
 - Self Consistency
 - Cross Validation
 - External Validation
